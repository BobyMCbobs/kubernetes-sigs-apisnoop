 io.k8s.api.batch.v1.JobSpec                                                                   | ttlSecondsAfterFinished   | integer                                                                                      | ttlSecondsAfterFinished limits the lifetime of a Job that has finished execution (either Complete or Failed). If this field is set, ttlSecondsAfterFinished after the Job finishes, it is eligible to be automatically deleted. When the Job is being deleted, its lifecycle guarantees (e.g. finalizers) will be honored. If this field is unset, the Job won't be automatically deleted. If this field is set to zero, the Job becomes eligible to be deleted immediately after it finishes. This field is alpha-level and is only honored by servers that enable the TTLAfterFinished feature.
 io.k8s.api.core.v1.CSIPersistentVolumeSource                                                  | controllerExpandSecretRef | io.k8s.api.core.v1.SecretReference                                                           | ControllerExpandSecretRef is a reference to the secret object containing sensitive information to pass to the CSI driver to complete the CSI ControllerExpandVolume call. This is an alpha field and requires enabling ExpandCSIVolumes feature gate. This field is optional, and may be empty if no secret is required. If the secret object contains more than one secret, all secrets are passed.
 io.k8s.api.core.v1.PodSpec                                                                    | ephemeralContainers       | io.k8s.api.core.v1.EphemeralContainer                                                        | EphemeralContainers is the list of ephemeral containers that run in this pod. Ephemeral containers are added to an existing pod as a result of a user-initiated action such as troubleshooting. This list is read-only in the pod spec. It may not be specified in a create or modified in an update of a pod or pod template. To add an ephemeral container use the pod's ephemeralcontainers subresource, which allows update using the EphemeralContainers kind. This field is alpha-level and is only honored by servers that enable the EphemeralContainers feature.
 io.k8s.api.core.v1.PodSpec                                                                    | overhead                  | integer                                                                                      | Overhead represents the resource overhead associated with running a pod for a given RuntimeClass. This field will be autopopulated at admission time by the RuntimeClass admission controller. If the RuntimeClass admission controller is enabled, overhead must not be set in Pod create requests. The RuntimeClass admission controller will reject Pod create requests which have the overhead already set. If RuntimeClass is configured and selected in the PodSpec, Overhead will be set to the value defined in the corresponding RuntimeClass, otherwise it will remain unset and treated as zero. More info: https://git.k8s.io/enhancements/keps/sig-node/20190226-pod-overhead.md This field is alpha-level as of Kubernetes v1.16, and is only honored by servers that enable the PodOverhead feature.

Scheduler will schedule pods in a way which abides by the constraints. This field is alpha-level and is only honored by clusters that enables the EvenPodsSpread feature. All topologySpreadConstraints are ANDed.
 io.k8s.apiextensions-apiserver.pkg.apis.apiextensions.v1beta1.CustomResourceConversion        | webhookClientConfig       | io.k8s.apiextensions-apiserver.pkg.apis.apiextensions.v1beta1.WebhookClientConfig            | `webhookClientConfig` is the instructions for how to call the webhook if strategy is `Webhook`. This field is alpha-level and is only honored by servers that enable the CustomResourceWebhookConversion feature.
 io.k8s.apiextensions-apiserver.pkg.apis.apiextensions.v1beta1.CustomResourceDefinitionVersion | additionalPrinterColumns  | io.k8s.apiextensions-apiserver.pkg.apis.apiextensions.v1beta1.CustomResourceColumnDefinition | AdditionalPrinterColumns are additional columns shown e.g. in kubectl next to the name. Defaults to a created-at column. Top-level and per-version columns are mutually exclusive. Per-version columns must not all be set to identical values (top-level columns should be used instead) This field is alpha-level and is only honored by servers that enable the CustomResourceWebhookConversion feature. NOTE: CRDs created prior to 1.13 populated the top-level additionalPrinterColumns field by default. To apply an update that changes to per-version additionalPrinterColumns, the top-level additionalPrinterColumns field must be explicitly set to null
 io.k8s.apiextensions-apiserver.pkg.apis.apiextensions.v1beta1.CustomResourceDefinitionVersion | schema                    | io.k8s.apiextensions-apiserver.pkg.apis.apiextensions.v1beta1.CustomResourceValidation       | Schema describes the schema for CustomResource used in validation, pruning, and defaulting. Top-level and per-version schemas are mutually exclusive. Per-version schemas must not all be set to identical values (top-level validation schema should be used instead) This field is alpha-level and is only honored by servers that enable the CustomResourceWebhookConversion feature.
 io.k8s.apiextensions-apiserver.pkg.apis.apiextensions.v1beta1.CustomResourceDefinitionVersion | subresources              | io.k8s.apiextensions-apiserver.pkg.apis.apiextensions.v1beta1.CustomResourceSubresources     | Subresources describes the subresources for CustomResource Top-level and per-version subresources are mutually exclusive. Per-version subresources must not all be set to identical values (top-level subresources should be used instead) This field is alpha-level and is only honored by servers that enable the CustomResourceWebhookConversion feature.

An empty value indicates that any CSI driver can be used for inline ephemeral volumes. This is an alpha field, and is only honored if the API server enables the CSIInlineVolume feature gate.
 io.k8s.apimachinery.pkg.apis.meta.v1.APIResource                                              | storageVersionHash        | string                                                                                       | The hash value of the storage version, the version this resource is converted to when written to the data store. Value must be treated as opaque by clients. Only equality comparison on the value is valid. This is an alpha feature and may change or be removed in the future. The field is populated by the apiserver only if the StorageVersionHash feature gate is enabled. This field will remain optional even if it graduates.
 io.k8s.api.node.v1alpha1.RuntimeClassSpec                                                     | overhead                  | io.k8s.api.node.v1alpha1.Overhead                                                            | Overhead represents the resource overhead associated with running a pod for a given RuntimeClass. For more details, see https://git.k8s.io/enhancements/keps/sig-node/20190226-pod-overhead.md This field is alpha-level as of Kubernetes v1.15, and is only honored by servers that enable the PodOverhead feature.

 io.k8s.api.core.v1.Container                    | volumeDevices         | io.k8s.api.core.v1.VolumeDevice                       | volumeDevices is the list of block devices to be used by the container. This is a beta feature.
 io.k8s.api.core.v1.EphemeralContainer           | volumeDevices         | io.k8s.api.core.v1.VolumeDevice                       | volumeDevices is the list of block devices to be used by the container. This is a beta feature.
 io.k8s.api.core.v1.PodSpec                      | runtimeClassName      | string                                                | RuntimeClassName refers to a RuntimeClass object in the node.k8s.io group, which should be used to run this pod.  If no RuntimeClass resource matches the named class, the pod will not be run. If unset or empty, the "legacy" RuntimeClass will be used, which is an implicit class with an empty definition that uses the default runtime handler. More info: https://git.k8s.io/enhancements/keps/sig-node/runtime-class.md This is a beta feature as of Kubernetes v1.14.
 io.k8s.api.core.v1.PodSpec                      | shareProcessNamespace | integer                                               | Share a single process namespace between all of the containers in a pod. When this is set containers will be able to view and signal processes from other containers in the same pod, and the first process in each container will not be assigned PID 1. HostPID and ShareProcessNamespace cannot both be set. Optional: Default to false. This field is beta-level and may be disabled with the PodShareProcessNamespace feature.
 io.k8s.api.core.v1.VolumeMount                  | mountPropagation      | string                                                | mountPropagation determines how mounts are propagated from the host to container and the other way around. When not set, MountPropagationNone is used. This field is beta in 1.10.
 io.k8s.api.core.v1.VolumeMount                  | subPathExpr           | string                                                | Expanded path within the volume from which the container's volume should be mounted. Behaves similarly to SubPath but environment variable references $(VAR_NAME) are expanded using the container's environment. Defaults to "" (volume's root). SubPathExpr and SubPath are mutually exclusive. This field is beta in 1.15.
 io.k8s.api.extensions.v1beta1.NetworkPolicySpec | egress                | io.k8s.api.extensions.v1beta1.NetworkPolicyEgressRule | List of egress rules to be applied to the selected pods. Outgoing traffic is allowed if there are no NetworkPolicies selecting the pod (and cluster policy otherwise allows the traffic), OR if the traffic matches at least one egress rule across all of the NetworkPolicy objects whose podSelector matches the pod. If this field is empty then this NetworkPolicy limits all outgoing traffic (and serves solely to ensure that the pods it selects are isolated by default). This field is beta-level in 1.8
 io.k8s.api.extensions.v1beta1.NetworkPolicySpec | policyTypes           | string                                                | List of rule types that the NetworkPolicy relates to. Valid options are "Ingress", "Egress", or "Ingress,Egress". If this field is not specified, it will default based on the existence of Ingress or Egress rules; policies that contain an Egress section are assumed to affect Egress, and all policies (whether or not they contain an Ingress section) are assumed to affect Ingress. If you want to write an egress-only policy, you must explicitly specify policyTypes [ "Egress" ]. Likewise, if you want to write a policy that specifies that no egress is allowed, you must specify a policyTypes value that include "Egress" (since such a policy would not include an Egress section and would otherwise default to just [ "Ingress" ]). This field is beta-level in 1.8
 io.k8s.api.networking.v1.NetworkPolicySpec      | egress                | io.k8s.api.networking.v1.NetworkPolicyEgressRule      | List of egress rules to be applied to the selected pods. Outgoing traffic is allowed if there are no NetworkPolicies selecting the pod (and cluster policy otherwise allows the traffic), OR if the traffic matches at least one egress rule across all of the NetworkPolicy objects whose podSelector matches the pod. If this field is empty then this NetworkPolicy limits all outgoing traffic (and serves solely to ensure that the pods it selects are isolated by default). This field is beta-level in 1.8

Valid options are "Ingress", "Egress", or "Ingress,Egress". If this field is not specified, it will default based on the existence of Ingress or Egress rules; policies that contain an Egress section are assumed to affect Egress, and all policies (whether or not they contain an Ingress section) are assumed to affect Ingress. If you want to write an egress-only policy, you must explicitly specify policyTypes [ "Egress" ]. Likewise, if you want to write a policy that specifies that no egress is allowed, you must specify a policyTypes value that include "Egress" (since such a policy would not include an Egress section and would otherwise default to just [ "Ingress" ]).

 minReplicas is the lower limit for the number of replicas to which the autoscaler can scale down.  It defaults to 1 pod.  minReplicas is allowed to be 0 if the alpha feature gate HPAScaleToZero is enabled and at least one Object or External metric is configured.  Scaling is active as long as at least one metric value is available.

 Versions is the list of all supported versions for this resource. If Version field is provided, this field is optional. Validation: All versions must use the same validation schema for now. i.e., top level Validation field is applied to all of these versions. Order: The version name will be used to compute the order. If the version string is "kube-like", it will sort above non "kube-like" version strings, which are ordered lexicographically. "Kube-like" versions start with a "v", then are followed by a number (the major version), then optionally the string "alpha" or "beta" and another number (the minor version). These are sorted first by GA > beta > alpha (where GA is a version with no suffix such as beta or alpha), and then by comparing major version, then minor version. An example sorted list of versions: v10, v2, v1, v11beta2, v10beta3, v3beta1, v12alpha1, v11alpha2, foo1, foo10.

 APIVersion holds the API group and version of the referenced subject. Defaults to "v1" for ServiceAccount subjects. Defaults to "rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1alpha1" for User and Group subjects.
 Standard object metadata. metadata.Name indicates the name of the CSI driver that this object refers to; it MUST be the same name returned by the CSI GetPluginName() call for that driver. The driver name must be 63 characters or less, beginning and ending with an alphanumeric character ([a-z0-9A-Z]) with dashes (-), dots (.), and alphanumerics between.

 GroupPriorityMininum is the priority this group should have at least. Higher priority means that the group is preferred by clients over lower priority ones. Note that other versions of this group might specify even higher GroupPriorityMininum values such that the whole group gets a higher priority. The primary sort is based on GroupPriorityMinimum, ordered highest number to lowest (20 before 10). The secondary sort is based on the alphabetical comparison of the name of the object.  (v1.bar before v1.foo) We'd recommend something like: *.k8s.io (except extensions) at 18000 and PaaSes (OpenShift, Deis) are recommended to be in the 2000s
 VersionPriority controls the ordering of this API version inside of its group.  Must be greater than zero. The primary sort is based on VersionPriority, ordered highest to lowest (20 before 10). Since it's inside of a group, the number can be small, probably in the 10s. In case of equal version priorities, the version string will be used to compute the order inside a group. If the version string is "kube-like", it will sort above non "kube-like" version strings, which are ordered lexicographically.

 AdmissionReviewVersions is an ordered list of preferred `AdmissionReview` versions the Webhook expects. API server will try to use first version in the list which it supports. If none of the versions specified in this list supported by API server, validation will fail for this object. If a persisted webhook configuration specifies allowed versions and does not include any versions known to the API Server, calls to the webhook will fail and be subject to the failure policy. Default to `['v1beta1']`.

 manualSelector controls generation of pod labels and pod selectors. Leave `manualSelector` unset unless you are certain what you are doing. When false or unset, the system pick labels unique to this job and appends those labels to the pod template.  When true, the user is responsible for picking unique labels and specifying the selector.  Failure to pick a unique label may cause this and other jobs to not function correctly.  However, You may see `manualSelector=true` in jobs that were created with the old `extensions/v1beta1` API.

 - Exact: match a request only if it exactly matches a specified rule. For example, if deployments can be modified via apps/v1, apps/v1beta1, and extensions/v1beta1, but "rules" only included `apiGroups:["apps"], apiVersions:["v1"], resources: ["deployments"]`, a request to apps/v1beta1 or extensions/v1beta1 would not be sent to the webhook.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    +

 - Equivalent: match a request if modifies a resource listed in rules, even via another API group or version. For example, if deployments can be modified via apps/v1, apps/v1beta1, and extensions/v1beta1, and "rules" only included `apiGroups:["apps"], apiVersions:["v1"], resources: ["deployments"]`, a request to apps/v1beta1 or extensions/v1beta1 would be converted to apps/v1 and sent to the webhook.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        +

 Defaults to "Exact"
 Name is the version name, e.g. “v1”, “v2beta1”, etc.
 Name is the version name, e.g. “v1”, “v2beta1”, etc.
 preserveUnknownFields disables pruning of object fields which are not specified in the OpenAPI schema. apiVersion, kind, metadata and known fields inside metadata are always preserved. Defaults to true in v1beta and will default to false in v1.
 SideEffects states whether this webhook has side effects. Acceptable values are: None, NoneOnDryRun (webhooks created via v1beta1 may also specify Some or Unknown). Webhooks with side effects MUST implement a reconciliation system, since a request may be rejected by a future step in the admission change and the side effects therefore need to be undone. Requests with the dryRun attribute will be auto-rejected if they match a webhook with sideEffects == Unknown or Some.

 version is the preferred version of the resource.  Empty implies the version of the containing resource list For subresources, this may have a different value, for example: v1 (while inside a v1beta1 version of the core resource's group)".
 VersionPriority controls the ordering of this API version inside of its group.  Must be greater than zero. The primary sort is based on VersionPriority, ordered highest to lowest (20 before 10). Since it's inside of a group, the number can be small, probably in the 10s. In case of equal version priorities, the version string will be used to compute the order inside a group. If the version string is "kube-like", it will sort above non "kube-like" version strings, which are ordered lexicographically. "Kube-like" versions start with a "v", then are followed by a number (the major version), then optionally the string "alpha" or "beta" and another number (the minor version). These are sorted first by GA > beta > alpha (where GA is a version with no suffix such as beta or alpha), and then by comparing major version, then minor version. An example sorted list of versions: v10, v2, v1, v11beta2, v10beta3, v3beta1, v12alpha1, v11alpha2, foo1, foo10.

 Versions is the list of all supported versions for this resource. If Version field is provided, this field is optional. Validation: All versions must use the same validation schema for now. i.e., top level Validation field is applied to all of these versions. Order: The version name will be used to compute the order.

 io.k8s.api.autoscaling.v2beta1.HorizontalPodAutoscalerSpec | minReplicas           | integer    | minReplicas is the lower limit for the number of replicas to which the autoscaler can scale down.  It defaults to 1 pod.  minReplicas is allowed to be 0 if the alpha feature gate HPAScaleToZero is enabled and at least one Object or External metric is configured.  Scaling is active as long as at least one metric value is available.
 io.k8s.api.autoscaling.v2beta2.HorizontalPodAutoscalerSpec | minReplicas           | integer    | minReplicas is the lower limit for the number of replicas to which the autoscaler can scale down.  It defaults to 1 pod.  minReplicas is allowed to be 0 if the alpha feature gate HPAScaleToZero is enabled and at least one Object or External metric is configured.  Scaling is active as long as at least one metric value is available.
 io.k8s.api.autoscaling.v1.HorizontalPodAutoscalerSpec      | minReplicas           | integer    | minReplicas is the lower limit for the number of replicas to which the autoscaler can scale down.  It defaults to 1 pod.  minReplicas is allowed to be 0 if the alpha feature gate HPAScaleToZero is enabled and at least one Object or External metric is configured.  Scaling is active as long as at least one metric value is available.
 io.k8s.api.core.v1.EphemeralContainer                      | targetContainerName   | string     | If set, the name of the container from PodSpec that this ephemeral container targets. The ephemeral container will be run in the namespaces (IPC, PID, etc) of this container. If not set then the ephemeral container is run in whatever namespaces are shared for the pod. Note that the container runtime must support this feature.
 io.k8s.api.core.v1.PodSpec                                 | runtimeClassName      | string     | RuntimeClassName refers to a RuntimeClass object in the node.k8s.io group, which should be used to run this pod.  If no RuntimeClass resource matches the named class, the pod will not be run. If unset or empty, the "legacy" RuntimeClass will be used, which is an implicit class with an empty definition that uses the default runtime handler. More info: https://git.k8s.io/enhancements/keps/sig-node/runtime-class.md This is a beta feature as of Kubernetes v1.14.
 io.k8s.api.core.v1.PodSpec                                 | shareProcessNamespace | integer    | Share a single process namespace between all of the containers in a pod. When this is set containers will be able to view and signal processes from other containers in the same pod, and the first process in each container will not be assigned PID 1. HostPID and ShareProcessNamespace cannot both be set. Optional: Default to false. This field is beta-level and may be disabled with the PodShareProcessNamespace feature.
