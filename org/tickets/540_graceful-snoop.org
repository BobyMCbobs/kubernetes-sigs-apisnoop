#+TITLE: 540 Graceful Snoop

* Goal
Add testing and better error checks to snoop utils, so we know every function
works as intended, and we can gracefully handle new edge cases in audit logs.

* Tasks
** TODO research testing in python
Python has unittesting included in its standard lib, with [[https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html][unittest]].
This will be the underlying testing i use, though it is a bit cumbersome
with boilerplate, specifically an object-oriented boilerplate.

I've read good things about pytest, which is like unittest without the boilerplate and with some nice feature for grouping tests and such.

It requires setting up a virtual environment and installing the module
as so

#+begin_src shell
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install pytest
#+end_src
** TODO simplilfy functions in snoop utils where able
** TODO can we add errors to a db? what would that look like?
** TODO do we need to add graceful changes to our sql queries?
