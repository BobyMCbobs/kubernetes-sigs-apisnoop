#+TITLE: Ticket 81: Move fieldwork to tables and views

* The Ticket
  [[https://gitlab.ii.coop/cncf/apisnoop/issues/81][gitlab link]]
* Process
  This was largely admin, moving the stuff in ticket_58's conclusion into our tables_and views section.  I did a basic copy paste, then ran through a teradown and build up of the app.  The buildup had some issues, but it feels more related to settling pains with our new emacs setup, then an issue with the views themselves.
* Conclusions || Next Steps
  The views been added!
* Footnotes
