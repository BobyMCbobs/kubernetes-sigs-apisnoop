The roadmap for the next stages is straightforward to me:

* Numbers Overtime first, sunburst second.
* Recent Changes List, and high-level breakdown by test run.
* Begin working on new client now, in tandem with database.
* Priority Views
** # of Tests per test run
** # of covered endpoints per test run
** Difference between two arbitrary test runs, more tests, more endpoints?
** Endpoints covered by specific, arbitrary test as of a test_run.
** per test_run, list of tests that cover <10 endpoints
** per test_run, list of endpoints that are covered by <10 tests.
