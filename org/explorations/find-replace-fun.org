#+TITLE: Find Replace Fun


* Purpose
  In our mock ticket template we have the text string RESOURCENAME which is a fill in until someone determines what exactly they are going to be writing a test for.  when that happens, the current flow is to select all the text and do a find/replace for resource name.  THis is a good simple pattern to replace with an apisnoop elisp function, and opportunity to learn a bit more elisp.
