#+TITLE: APISnoop 1.19 OKRs
#+AUTHOR: ii.coop

* v1.19
Our goal is to not make radical changes to process or approach, but iterate on our working methods to increase velocity and output in a stable, consistent way.

  The results will be evaluated as we go forward

*** **Conformance and Historical Endpoint data**
  - [[https://apisnoop.cncf.io][apisnoop.cncf.io]] been updated
    - First page show the sunburst graph at the top of the page
      - With data from 1.15 on wards
    - Confromance progress is shown in 3 graphs
      -  Stable Endpoint Coverage At Time of Release
      -  Stable Endpoint Coverage At Time of Release (%)
      -  Conformance Coverage By Release
    - Historical Endpoint [GET THE CORRECT URL][graphs]]
      - PR [[https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/1806][#1806]] API's promoted to GA must come with conformance tests
*** **APISnoop updates**
**** Generating yaml and json files for coverage to make it easier for other apps to consume
 - discussing this in [[https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/92631][PR 92631]], and last conformance office hours
 - will likely keep this out of tree, but usefulness of these files feels clear.
**** **New snoop site using our output json files**
   - [[https://snoop-app.vercel.app]] is preview of new site
   - pulls all data from github repo holding coverage info
     - can use similar process for prowbots and gates
   - improved routing (navigate via release instead of bucket and job)
   - conformance progress added as new page
   - about page added with more info on our process and update frequency.
**** **Discovered increase in coverage with Serial and Disruption tests**
   - there are a set of conformance tests that were not included in the buckets we drew our testdata from.
   - these tests are being run in a different e2e test run.
   - by combining the data sets, we can see all the conformance tests and which endpoints they hit.
**** **Discovery**
  - doing this work uncovered 17 new endpoints hit by conformance tests.
  - this number is reflected in our new app and on the landing page of apisnoop.cncf.io
*** ** JULY APISnoop**
**** easy to run snoopDB as one docker run command
     this helps us with pipeline for updating coverage, but also makes it easy for spin up their own database and investigate k8s coverage.
     with the snoopdb image, you can run something as simple as ~docker run -p 5432:5432 snoopdb~, which will create a postgres database with tables for:
     - the entire open api spec
     - the entire set of conformance tests
     - coverage data taken from e2e test suite runs
    all of it loaded with fresh data ready to explore.
**** automating the updates of our coverage jsons
     apisnoop updating daily with through github actions pipeline
**** listing new endpoints beneath sunburst
      homepage listes new endpoints for this release, sorted to have stable, non-conformance tested endpoints at top of list.

**** New graph on conformance-progress: Stable Endpoint Coverage at Time Of Release(Percentage)
     this graph shows the coverage ratio for each release, which better shows the work done to cover older endpoints.
**** NEXT UP
***** Improved styling and ux/ui for sunburst page
      it's a proof of concept awaiting feedback, but we want to make it more user-friendly and discoverable
***** List of tests that hit an endpoint shown on sunburst, when zoomed into an endpoint
      This already exists but was turned off to work out some issues with its filters, and we'll be adding it back to the site.
***** New Coverage showing below sunburst
      this table would show existing endpoints but that are newly tested in this release.

***** Increased documentation for snoopdb
      everything within the database is commented, but external documentation would make it far more beginner friendly, and we'll be tackling that next.

*** Background
    Influenced by [[https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/1666/files?short_path=92a9412#diff-92a9412ae55358378bc66295cdbea103][Behavior KEP user stories]] while continuing to focus on endpoints!

 #+begin_quote
 Will show increase in endpoints, and tested endpoints, but also, explicitly, whether conformance coverage increased.
 #+end_quote

 #+begin_quote
 Comment: "you are adding a new endpoint to stable, and you are adding a conformance test for it"
 #+end_quote
*** OKing PR

#+begin_quote
Existing responsiblity via owners file ensures that PRs touching swagger or conformance tests are **/approved** by right people.
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
A label of **requires-conformance** will applied, and **conformance** label will need to be added by this gate + automation.
#+end_quote
*** KR1 Identify a PR as requiring conformance review
PR must touch file in conformance-specific directory

- (initially /area-conformance + /sig-arch)
- [ ] Create ~run_if_changed~ presubmit

#+begin_example
eg: update test/conformance/behaviors/..
eg: mv from test/e2e to test/conformance
#+end_example
*** KR2 Identify list of endpoints added/removed
Tooling will compare ~path/operation_id~ in ~api/openapi-spec/swagger.json~
- [ ] Generate list of new endpoints
- [ ] Generate list of removed endpoints
*** KR3 Run APISnoop against PR to generate endpoint coverage
Tooling will provide a list of tested and conformant endpoints.
- [ ] Wait for main prow job to finish
- [ ] Generate list of hit/tested endpoints
- [ ] Generate list of conformant endpoints
*** KR4 bot comment w/ list of increase/decrease of endpoints
Tooling will comment directly on PR

- [ ] alpha : endpoints needing tests
- [ ] beta : endpoints needing tests
- [ ] stable : comment+block via tag

#+begin_quote
You've added api's without tests it will not be able to reach stable.
#+end_quote
*** KR5 Manual Approval for SIG-Arch (or appropriate owners)
Ensure the API Review process has been followed.

- [ ] Get feedback on approval process from SIG-Arch
- [ ] Ensure the correct tagging / OWNERS are respected
*** KR6 Donate APISnoop to sig-arch
- [ ] Get feedback if this is desired
- [ ] Get as to location of repo under k8s org
- [ ] Migration maybe in Q4
** Increase Stable Test Coverage by 40 endpoints
*** **KR1 (14/40) new conformant stable endpoints**
- #89753 + 5 points
- #90390 + 3 points
- #90812 + 1 point
- #90941 + 2 points
- #92813 + 1 point
- #93084 + 1 point
- #93038 + 1 point Ingress Endpoint
*** **What is in the numbers**
- 14 Endpoints by ii
- 39 Endpoints by the community
Total: 53
- 21 Promotion Endpoints by ii
- 17 Watch tooling test Endpoints by ii
Total: 38
**Grand total possible: 91**
*** **KR2 (9.61% / +9%) Coverage Increase**
  **38.86%->48.47%**
- Target have been exceeded with ii and the community's effort
- Further increase expected before 1.19 test freeze
- Due to increase in total endpoints, our increase may be hidden.
Percentage many not be a clear indicator.
*** **KR3 (stretch +49) 50% stable endpoints hit by conformance tests**
- Possibly, only need Conformance tests for 7 more Endpoints to Merge
