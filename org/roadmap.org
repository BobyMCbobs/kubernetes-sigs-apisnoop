*** Historical Endpoint and Conformance data
  - Two [[https://www.instantinfrastructure.com/snoop/][graphs]] have been prepared using the following underling data:
    - New [[https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/test/conformance/testdata/conformance.yaml][Conformance.yaml]]
    - 1.9-1.18 release tags for OpenAPI json
    - Latest release-blocking prow job audit.log
*** APISnoop updates
**** Generating yaml and json files for coverage to make it easier for other apps to consume
 - discussing this in [[https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/92631][pr 92631]], and last conformance office hours
 - will likely keep this out of tree, but usefulness of these files feels clear.
**** New snoop site using our output json files
  - [[https://snoop-app.vercel.app]] is preview of new site
  - pulls all data from github repo holding coverage info
    - can use similar process for prowbots and gates
  - improved routing (navigate via release instead of bucket and job)
  - conformance progress added as new page 
  - about page added with more info on our process and update frequency.
**** Discovered increase in coverage with Serial and Disruption tests
  - there are a set of conformance tests that were not included in the buckets we drew our testdata from.
  - these tests are being run in a a different e2e test run.
  - by combining the data sets, we can see all the conformance tests and which endpoints they hit.
  - doing this work uncovered 17 new endpoints hit by conformance tests.
  - this number is reflected in our new app and on the landing page of apisnoop.cncf.io
**** Next Up: automating the updates of our coverage jsons
**** Next Up: listing new, untested endpoints sorted by recency

** Gate k/k PRs touching test/e2e or API
- [[https://github.com/cncf/apisnoop/projects/30][k/k API+Conformance Gate]]
*** Background
    Influenced by [[https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/1666/files?short_path=92a9412#diff-92a9412ae55358378bc66295cdbea103][Behavior KEP user stories]] while continuing to focus on endpoints!

 #+begin_quote
 Will show increase in endpoints, and tested endpoints, but also, explicitly, whether conformance coverage increased.
 #+end_quote

 #+begin_quote
 Comment: "you are adding a new endpoint to stable, and you are adding a conformance test for it"
 #+end_quote
*** OKing PR

#+begin_quote
Existing responsiblity via owners file ensures that PRs touching swagger or conformance tests are **/approved** by right people.
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
A label of **requires-conformance** will applied, and **conformance** label will need to be added by this gate + automation.
#+end_quote
*** KR1 Identify a PR as requiring conformance review
PR must touch file in conformance-specific directory

- (initially /area-conformance + /sig-arch)
- [ ] Create ~run_if_changed~ presubmit

#+begin_example
eg: update test/conformance/behaviors/..
eg: mv from test/e2e to test/conformance
#+end_example
*** KR2 Identify list of endpoints added/removed
Tooling will compare ~path/operation_id~ in ~api/openapi-spec/swagger.json~
- [ ] Generate list of new endpoints
- [ ] Generate list of removed endpoints
*** KR3 Run APISnoop against PR to generate endpoint coverage
Tooling will provide a list of tested and conformant endpoints.
- [ ] Wait for main prow job to finish
- [ ] Generate list of hit/tested endpoints
- [ ] Generate list of conformant endpoints
*** KR4 bot comment w/ list of increase/decrease of endpoints
Tooling will comment directly on PR

- [ ] alpha : endpoints needing tests
- [ ] beta : endpoints needing tests
- [ ] stable : comment+block via tag

#+begin_quote
You've added api's without tests it will not be able to reach stable.
#+end_quote
*** KR5 Manual Approval for SIG-Arch (or appropriate owners)
Ensure the API Review process has been followed.

- [ ] Get feedback on approval process from SIG-Arch
- [ ] Ensure the correct tagging / OWNERS are respected
*** KR6 Donate APISnoop to sig-arch
- [ ] Get feedback if this is desired
- [ ] Get as to location of repo under k8s org
- [ ] Migration maybe in Q4
** Increase Stable Test Coverage by 40 endpoints
*** KR1 (8/40) new conformant stable endpoints
- #89753 + 5 points
- #90390 + 3 points
- #91416 Add watch event tooling
*** KR2 +9% Coverage Increase 36.46%->45.46%
Due to increase in total endpoints, our increase may be hidden.
Percentage many not be a clear indicator.
- 34.15%->38.30% => +3.85%
- 36.46%->38.30% => +1.84%
*** KR3 (stretch +49) 50% stable endpoints hit by conformance tests
- Possibly, but it will be a stretch
