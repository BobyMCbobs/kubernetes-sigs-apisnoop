#+TITLE: APISnoop 1.20 OKRs
#+AUTHOR: ii.coop

* v1.20 
Our goal is to not make radical changes to process or approach, but iterate on our working methods to increase velocity and output in a stable, consistent way.
** Looking forward to 1.20
** **Increase Stable Test Coverage**
*** **KR1 increase new conformant stable endpoints**
- Goal: 30
- Stretch Goal: 40
- Current Status:
  Test write:
  PR of 7 Endpoint form the "Proxy" group
  3 PR's for 17 Endpoints with intermittend flakes
*** **KR2 clean-up technical debt**
- Goal: Clean technical debt back to 1.15
  Technical Debt have been clear with the last inligible endpoints identified
- Stretch Goal: 6 of 18 Endpoints of 1.14
*** **Release Blocking k/k Jobs touching test/e2e or API**
This will likely change quite a bit as we move to Release Blocking Job instead of PR blocking Job.
*** **KR1: Identify list of endpoints added/removed**
*** **KR2: Tooling will provide a list of tested and conformant endpoints.**
*** **APISnoop landing page**
Updates made:
- Improved color to better contrast the work done
- Graph descriptions improved
- About page information improved with more documentation links
- List documents:
  - Conformance Testing in Kubernetes
  - Promoting Tests to Conformance
  - Writing good e2e tests for Kubernetes
  - Link to Conformance Office Hours Meeting Notes
** **Looking forward to a successful 1.20**

* Footnotes
** **Increase Stable Test Coverage by 40 endpoints**
*** **KR1 (39/40) new conformant stable endpoints**
 - Community introduced 41 New endpoints to GA
 - 40 Endpoint was introduced with tests
 - ii introduced Conformance tests for 38 old endpoints
 - ii added a Conformance test to 1 new endpoints promoted without a test
*** **KR2 (17.54% / +9%) Coverage Increase**
   **38.86%->56.4%**
 - Target have been exceeded with ii and the community's effort
 - Percentage would not be used as a measure from 1.20
 - Percentage many not be a clear indicator due to:
   - New endpoints, deprecation and ineligible endpoints etc.
*** **KR3 (stretch 56.4%) +50% stable endpoints hit by conformance tests**
 - Achieved by the team work of ii and the community
