#+TITLE: APISnoop 1.20 OKRs
#+AUTHOR: ii.coop

* v1.20 
Our goal is to not make radical changes to process or approach, but iterate on our working methods to increase velocity and output in a stable, consistent way.
** Looking back at 1.19
*** OKR Scoring
   - **Gate cncf/k8s-conformance PR's**
     - Result: 0.9 (Final Switchover Pending)
   - **Gate k/k of PR's touching test/e2e or API**
     - Result: 0.4 (Major Direction Change)
   - **Increase Stable Test Coverage**
     - Result: 1.0 (Best Ever)
*** **Gate cncf/k8s-conformance PR's**
   - **KR1** Setup prow.cncf.io
   - **KR2** Connect cncf/k8s-conformance to prow.cncf.io
   - **KR3** gate+comment
   * The Conformance gate is implemented and tested on 
    [[https://github.com/cncf-infra/k8s-conformance/][cncf-infra/k8s-conformance]].
   * CNCF Approval needed to point at [[https://github.com/cncf/k8s-conformance/][cncf/k8s-conformance]].
*** **Final Switchover for cncf/K8s-conformance gate**
   - [[https://github.com/cncf/k8s-conformance/pull/1070][Update Docs]] to only allow single submissions
   - Set implementation date / switch over
*** **Gate k/k of PR's touching test/e2e or API**
   - **KRs** Will be updated for 1.20
   - Feedback from #sig-testing / #sig-contribex
     - Discouraged: **PR Blocking Presubmits**
     - Prefered: **Release Blocking Periodic**
   - We are soliciting feedback from SIG Testing on the technical details
*** **Increase Stable Test Coverage by 40 endpoints**
   - **KR1** (39/40) new conformant stable endpoints
   - **KR2** (17.54% / +9%) Coverage Increase
   - **KR3** (stretch 56.4%) +50% stable endpoints hit by conformance tests
** **Achievements not in OKRs for 1.19**
*** Preventing further technical debt
- Two Endpoints Beta->GA sans Conformance
- Picked-up by APISnoop
- Conformance Tests added
*** APISnoop improvements
- Conformance-Coverage Graphs
- New Release Endpoints beneath sunburst
- Standalone SnoopDB
  - (openAPI spec + conformance coverage)
** Looking forward to 1.20
** **Increase Stable Test Coverage**
*** **KR1 increase new conformant stable endpoints**
- Goal: 30
- Stretch Goal: 40
- Remaining 50% conformance seems of increased complexity
*** **KR2 clean-up technical debt**
- Goal: Clean technical debt back to 1.15
- Stretch Goal: 6 of 18 Endpoints of 1.14

** **Release Blocking k/k Jobs touching test/e2e or API**
This will likely change quite a bit as we move to Release Blocking Job instead of PR blocking Job.
*** **KR1: Identify list of endpoints added/removed**
- Tooling will compare path/operation id in api/openapi-spec/swagger.json
  - Generate list of new endpoints
  - Generate list of removed endpoints
- Run APISnoop against PR to generate endpoint coverage review
*** **KR2: Tooling will provide a list of tested and conformant endpoints.**
  - Wait for main prow job to finish
  - Generate list of hit/tested endpoints
  - Generate list of conformant endpoints
  - Bot comment with list of increase/decrease of endpoints
*** **KR3: Tooling will comment directly on PR + Link to APISnoop landing page**
- **Alpha & Beta:** List endpoints needing tests. Note: Endpoints can not be promoted to GA without Conformance test.
- **Stable:** comment via tag. (List endpoints needing tests. Note: Endpoints can not be promoted to GA without Conformance test.)
*** **APISnoop landing page**
Explain conformance testing is a requirement for Endpoints to be promoted to GA
- List documents:
 - Conformance Test Requirements
 - Promoting Tests to Conformance
 - Writing good e2e tests for Kubernetes
 - Introduction to APISnoop tool + links
 - Explanation & Access to different release data
 - Link to Conformance Office Hours Meeting Notes
** **Looking forward to a successful 1.20**

* Footnotes
** **Increase Stable Test Coverage by 40 endpoints**
*** **KR1 (39/40) new conformant stable endpoints**
 - Community introduced 41 New endpoints to GA
 - 40 Endpoint was introduced with tests
 - ii introduced Conformance tests for 38 old endpoints
 - ii added a Conformance test to 1 new endpoints promoted without a test
*** **KR2 (17.54% / +9%) Coverage Increase**
   **38.86%->56.4%**
 - Target have been exceeded with ii and the community's effort
 - Percentage would not be used as a measure from 1.20
 - Percentage many not be a clear indicator due to:
   - New endpoints, deprecation and ineligible endpoints etc.
*** **KR3 (stretch 56.4%) +50% stable endpoints hit by conformance tests**
 - Achieved by the team work of ii and the community
