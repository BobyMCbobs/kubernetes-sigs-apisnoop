#+TITLE: APISnoop 1.21 OKRs
#+AUTHOR: ii.coop

* v1.21
  Our goal is to not make radical changes to process or approach, but iterate on our working methods to increase velocity and output in a stable, consistent way.
** **Increase Stable Test Coverage**
*** **KR1 increase new conformant stable endpoints**
In spite of increasing technical challenges:
- Goal: 22/30   - Stretch Goal: 40
  - [[https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/97327][Read Status, Patch & List APIService +3]]
  - [[https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/95503][PodProxyWithPath & ServiceProxyWithPath + 12]]
  - [[https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/98126][Update: StatefulSet Replica scaling- Patch Scale +1]]
  - [[https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/99282][ReplicaSetScale test to Conformance +3]]
  - [[https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/99281][DeploymentScale test to Conformance +3]]
*** **KR2 clean-up technical debt**
- Goal: Clear [[https://apisnoop.cncf.io/conformance-progress#coverage-by-release][debt back to 1.9]]
6 months of debt to erase!
  1.11 +2: {read,patch}ApiregistrationStatus
- 1.10 +5: {replace,patch,list,...}Apiregistration
- 4 Endpoints to go
- These endpoints are block due to a [[https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/99568][possible bug]]
*** What is in the pipeline
  Promotion PR to merge next week
- [[https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/98018][Service Status Life Cycle +4]]
  Ready for approval
- [[https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/99380][Write ReplicaSet Replace and Patch Test +2]]
  Ready for promotion on 11 March
- [[https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/90877][AppsV1DaemonSet resource lifecycle  +5]] a work in progress
*** Apps endpoints
- All the 1.9 Technical debt is in the Apps API group
- An [[https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/98640][Umbrella Issue]] was created and we are working with SIG App to erase that debt
- The cover for [[https://apisnoop.cncf.io/1.21.0/stable/apps][Apps endpoints]] moved from 48% in 1.20 to [[https://apisnoop.cncf.io/1.21.0/stable/apps][62%]] in 1.21
*** Taking ownership to the community
  - ii currently manage the Ineligible endpoints list
  - This is done via SQL queries in APISnoop
  - We proposed in SIG Architecture to move it
    to the community
  - [[https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/98677][PR  #98677]] will make it happen
** **Other Important News**
*** **Timelines**
- 1.21 [[https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/tree/master/releases/release-1.21#timeline][Time line is out]]
- 14 week cycle with Test freeze on 24 March
*** **Conformance Gate**
- We  experienced some issues due to changes made to the 1.20 release branch
after the release was cut.
- It was fixed with [[https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/99081/][PR99081]]
- The community is currenly looking at ways to protect release branches in Github
*** The Conformance goal for 2021
  - Increase Stable Test Coverage for Kubernetes for 2021
    - Less than 75 untested eligible stable GA endpoints remaining.
    - Ensure no new technical debt is incurred.
*** KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe
    We will present a Maintainer Track Sessions
    on Conformance progress and it's
    importance.

  a big community topic
