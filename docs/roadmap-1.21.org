#+TITLE: APISnoop 1.21 OKRs
#+AUTHOR: ii.coop

* v1.21
  Our goal is to not make radical changes to process or approach, but iterate on our working methods to increase velocity and output in a stable, consistent way.
** **Increase Stable Test Coverage**
*** **KR1 increase new conformant stable endpoints**
In spite of increasing technical challenges:
- Goal: 28/30   - Stretch Goal: 40
  - [[https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/97327][Read Status, Patch & List APIService +3]]
  - [[https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/95503][Pod- & ServiceProxyWithPath + 12]]
  - [[https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/98126][StatefulSet Replica scaling +1]]
  - [[https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/99282][ReplicaSetScale test +3]]
  - [[https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/99281][DeploymentScale test +3]]
  - [[https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/98018][Service Status Life Cycle +4]]
  - [[https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/99380][ReplicaSet Replace and Patch Test +2]]

*** **KR2 clean-up technical debt**
- Goal: Clear [[https://apisnoop.cncf.io/conformance-progress#coverage-by-release][debt back to 1.9]]
6 months of debt to erase!
  1.11 +2: {read,patch}ApiregistrationStatus
- 1.10 +5: {replace,patch,list,...}Apiregistration
- 4 Endpoints to go
- These endpoints are block due to a [[https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/99568][possible bug]]
*** What is in the pipeline
- [[https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/94786][Write AppsV1DaemonSetStatus test - +3 endpoints #100507]]
- [[https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/94786][Write PodProxy Redirect Test - +7 endpoint coverage #94786]]
*** Apps endpoints
- All the 1.9 Technical debt is in the Apps API group
- An [[https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/98640][Umbrella Issue]] was created and we are working with SIG App to erase that debt
- The cover for [[https://apisnoop.cncf.io/1.21.0/stable/apps][Apps endpoints]] moved from 48% in 1.20 to [[https://apisnoop.cncf.io/1.21.0/stable/apps][62%]] in 1.21
*** Taking ownership to the community
  - ii currently manage the Ineligible endpoints list
  - This is done via SQL queries in APISnoop
  - SIG Architecture agreed to move it
    to the community
  - [[https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/98677][PR  #98677]] will make it happen
  - APISnoop functionallity will be updated in 1.22
*** Beta Endpoints graduation to GA
- 32 new endpoints to GA
- Endpoints for:
  - CronJob
  - EndpointSlice
  - PodDisruptionBudget
** **Other Important News**
*** **Timelines**
- 1.22 timeline is not avalble yet
- It should be another 14 week cycle
*** **Conformance Gate**
- We  experienced some issues due to changes made to the 1.20 release branch
after the release was cut.
- It was fixed with [[https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/99081/][PR99081]]
- Block conformance changes on release branches in k/k [[https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pull/21082][#21082]] was intruduced to protect release branches
- [[https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pull/21092][#21092]] reverted the change an must be revisited in 1.22
*** The Conformance goal for 2021
  - Increase Stable Test Coverage for Kubernetes for 2021
    - Less than 75 untested eligible stable GA endpoints remaining.
    - Ensure no new technical debt is incurred.
    - At the end of 1.22 there is 123 endpoints remaining
*** KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe
    ii will present a Maintainer Track Sessions
    on Conformance progress and it's
    importance.
    Wednesday May 5, 2021 12:20 CEST
** **Traget for 1.22**
- Conformance tests for 20 previously untested endpoints
** **Blockers for 1.22**
- Know that Endpoints get tougher
- Status endpoints is currently
  a big community topic
** **Questions / Feedback**
In what other ways can we support the CNCF?
