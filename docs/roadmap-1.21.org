  Our goal is to not make radical changes to process or approach, but iterate on our working methods to increase velocity and output in a stable, consistent way.
** **Increase Stable Test Coverage**
*** **KR1 increase new conformant stable endpoints**
In spite of increasing technical challenges:
- Goal: 3/30   - Stretch Goal: 40
- Status: +3 (Merged):
  - [[https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/97327][Read Status, Patch & List APIService +3]]
*** **KR2 clean-up technical debt**

6 months of debt to erase!
- 1.11 +2: {read,patch}ApiregistrationStatus
- 1.10 +5: {replace,patch,list,...}Apiregistration
- 3 of theses endpoints are coved by our first merged test for 1.21
